					<h2>About the databook</h2>
					<p>Modern medicine increasingly relies on data to improve the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment
						of illness. While clinical records and treatment outcomes are central to this process, they
						often overlook personal stories and everyday experiences that shape how individuals live with
						and respond to illness. Including these perspectives offers insights that can reveal needs,
						challenges, and contexts not captured by conventional medical data, contributing to a more
						comprehensive understanding of health. The databook organises these lived experiences using a
						set of guiding questions developed in collaboration with clinical experts. This structure
						ensures that the information is coherent, accessible, and conducive to identifying patterns and
						connections. Beyond serving as a repository, the databook invites interpretation by both experts
						and non-experts, positioning personal narratives as a meaningful form of knowledge that
						complements clinical evidence and enriches healthcare research.</p>

				<div id="stories-instructions">
					<h2>Instructions</h2>
					<p>Stories are displayed in reverse chronological order, with the most recent at the top. Each is
						numbered for reference. Black text shows the fixed narrative structure, while coloured text
						represents individual contributions. Inputs are categorised by content and can be filtered using
						the options below. Glyphs offer additional navigation: ✧ reveals definitions of less familiar
						terms, while
						<span class="number-container">
							<span class="number-icon">10</span>
						</span>
						indicate how many times a term appears across stories and link to other entries using
						the same word, and the at the end provides the original content when the story was submitted in
						a language other than English.</p>
