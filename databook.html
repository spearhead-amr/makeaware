			  <h2 id="abstract-text">The databook presents personal experiences of antibiotic consumption through visual navigation. Stories collected via the story-collection tool are organised into categories derived from participants’ input, accessible through filters that can be selected or deselected to reveal patterns, contexts, and perspectives, and contribute to a deeper understanding of antibiotic use in everyday life.</h2>

				<h2>About the databook</h2>
				<p>Modern medicine increasingly relies on data to improve the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of illness. While clinical records and treatment outcomes are central to this process, they often overlook personal stories and everyday experiences that shape how individuals live with and respond to illness. Including these perspectives offers insights that can reveal needs, challenges, and contexts not captured by conventional medical data, contributing to a more comprehensive understanding of health. The databook organises these lived experiences using a set of guiding questions developed in collaboration with clinical experts. This structure ensures that the information is coherent, accessible, and conducive to identifying patterns and connections. Beyond serving as a repository, the databook invites interpretation by both experts and non-experts, positioning personal narratives as a meaningful form of knowledge that complements clinical evidence and enriches healthcare research.</p>

				<h2>Instructions</h2>
				<p>PStories are displayed in reverse chronological order, with the most recent at the top. Each is numbered for reference. Black text shows the fixed narrative structure, while coloured text represents individual contributions. Inputs are categorised by content and can be filtered using the options below. Glyphs offer additional navigation: ✧ reveals definitions of less familiar terms, while ⑩ indicate how many times a term appears across stories and link to other entries using the same word, and the     at the end provides the original content when the story was submitted in a language other than English.</p>
