		<h2 class="chatbot-info-box-title">This chatbot was designed to make the project’s content and methods accessible through an experimental conversational approach. It provides clear information about the project’s goals, methods, and results, and can also answer general questions about antimicrobial resistance (AMR) to help citizens and non-experts better understand the issues of resistance and antibiotic use.</h2>

			<h3>Key Features</h3>
            <p>The chatbot can be interrogated about the MAKEAWARE! project’s objectives, research methods, workshops, and findings, as well as broader questions about antimicrobial resistance (AMR). For instance, the chatbot addresses question like: “What is the main goal of the MAKEAWARE! project?”, “How does it involve citizens in its research?”, or “What is the Digital Petri Laboratory" (DiPLab) and how does it work?”. The chatbot can also explain how creative approaches like data visualization are used to explore antibiotic resistance, and it can share the project’s outcomes, publications, and challenges. In addition, it can answer questions such as “What is antimicrobial resistance?”, “Why is AMR considered a global health threat?”, and “How does it affect people, animals, and the environment?”. Through these conversations, the chatbot helps users understand both the MAKEAWARE! project and the wider challenge of AMR.</p>

			<h3>Knowledge Base</h3>
            <p>To answer the questions, the chatbot relies on a primary knowledge base that functions as the institutional memory of the MAKEAWARE! project. This is a dedicated repository containing documents created directly by the project's own researchers, designers, and collaborators. It serves as the project's internal library, holding its official publications, detailed workshop plans, research papers, and other internal documentation. This allows it to provide a first-hand, detailed account of the project's unique identity, its operational methods, and the specific findings that have emerged from its research.
				<br><br>Additionally, the chatbot's secondary knowledge base provides the broader scientific landscape in which the MAKEAWARE! project is situated. This collection is composed of authoritative reports, articles, and fact sheets from respected external sources, including the World Health Organization (WHO) and major scientific journals. These documents were created by the global community of experts studying antimicrobial resistance (AMR). This knowledge provides the crucial, evidence-based context that underscores the importance and urgency of the resistance treat.</p>

			<h3>Development Process</h3>
            <p>The chatbot was developed using <a href="https://gooey.ai/" target="_blank">Gooey.ai</a>, a low-code platform that enables the creation of conversational agents through a visual workflow combining text, documents, and simple logic without requiring programming skills. A participatory session with the MAKEAWARE! team helped define the chatbot’s goals and purpose, ensuring that its tone, content, and functionality reflected the project’s values and communication needs. Following this co-design phase, the chatbot was further refined and integrated into this project’s final repository, where it now serves as an accessible entry point to explore the project’s outcomes and methods.</p>
