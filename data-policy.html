			<h1>Data Privacy and Management Policy (DPMP)</h1>
			</br>
			<p>This Data Privacy and Data Management Policy (DPDM) outlines the principles, responsibilities, and
				measures adopted by the MAKEAWARE! initiative to ensure the secure, ethical, and transparent handling of
				both personal and research data. It defines how data are collected, processed, protected, shared, and
				preserved throughout the project’s lifecycle.</p>

			<h2>Scope and purpose</h2>
			<p>The policy integrates the objectives of a Data Privacy Policy (focused on confidentiality, consent, and
				compliance with data protection laws — with those of a Data Management Plan) focused on the
				organisation, storage, and long-term stewardship of research outputs.
				<br><br>MAKEAWARE! is part of Subproject 3 of the SPEARHEAD research programme, developed by the
				University of Applied Sciences and Arts of Southern Switzerland (SUPSI) and funded by Innosuisse. The
				initiative investigates public knowledge and narratives related to antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and
				urinary tract infections (UTIs) through participatory and design-driven research. Individuals taking
				part in MAKEAWARE! contribute information and personal stories through collaborative activities. These
				contributions support the creation of anonymised datasets and resources intended for public use,
				scientific research, and communication.
				<br><br>This DPDM ensures that all data handled within MAKEAWARE! are managed in accordance with ethical
				research standards, institutional data governance policies, and Swiss data protection legislation.
				<br><br>MAKEAWARE! project has been reviewed and approved by the SUPSI Ethics Commission (<a
					href="https://www.supsi.ch/en/ethical-commission" class="in-text-citation"
					target="_blank">https://www.supsi.ch/en/ethical-commission</a>), which verified compliance with
				legal, ethical, and technical standards for research involving personal and health-related data.

			<h2>Repository navigation and hosting</h2>
			<p>The MAKEAWARE! website is hosted on GitHub Pages, a service operated by GitHub, Inc., part of Microsoft
				Corporation. The project team does not collect, store, or process any personal or identifiable
				information from site visitors. However, GitHub may automatically gather certain technical and
				navigation data—such as IP addresses, browser types, usage statistics, and cookies—as part of its
				platform operations. These data may be collected and processed exclusively under GitHub’s own Privacy
				Statement (<a
					href="https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement"
					class="in-text-citation"
					target="_blank">https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement</a>)
				and Terms of Service. The MAKEAWARE! team has no access to and does not use any information that GitHub
				may collect. In accordance with GitHub’s usage policy, which restricts access to individuals aged 13 and
				above, the MAKEAWARE! website inherits this limitation. A link to GitHub’s privacy policy is included in
				the website footer to ensure transparency.

			<h2>The story collection tool</h2>
			<p>The story collection tool is an interactive interface used to collect stories and reflections related to
				antibiotic consumption, urinary tract infections (UTIs), and awareness of antimicrobial resistance
				(AMR). It invites contributors—whether former workshop participants or online visitors—to describe their
				experiences with antibiotic prescription and use by responding to a set of guiding questions. These
				prompts are designed to support structured data collection while allowing individuals to share content
				they consider meaningful.
				<br><br>The form operates through an API-based system that transmits each submission directly to the
				project’s institutional email account. Once received, the stories are unpacked and organised into a
				structured dataset hosted on SUPSI’s institutional OneDrive server, following the format of the original
				submissions. Each text entry is preserved exactly as provided to ensure faithful representation and
				enable accurate subsequent analysis.
				<br><br>Collected stories are compiled into a structured dataset, in which each row corresponds to an
				individual contribution and each column reflects one of the original questions or prompts. Formatting
				elements such as colour are maintained from the original submission to support legibility and assist
				with early-stage interpretation.
				<br><br>No personal identifiers—such as names or contact details—are requested or stored. While certain
				metadata (e.g. IP addresses) may be technically included in the email transmission, such data is not
				accessed or used in any processing. All entries are fully anonymised before inclusion in the dataset.
				<br><br>The anonymised dataset is available for download directly from the project website. The data
				have been used within the MAKEAWARE! project to:

			</ul>

			<h2>Workshop outputs</h2>
			<p>As part of the collaborative activities conducted during the MAKEAWARE! workshops, participants were
				invited to share personal reflections and experiences related to antimicrobial resistance (AMR),
				antibiotic use, and urinary tract infections (UTIs). These contributions were central to the co-creation
				methodology of the project and took various forms, including photographs, drawings, written stories, and
				group-generated visual materials.
				<br><br>The materials produced during these sessions were documented to capture the collective outcomes
				of the workshops. These outputs have been curated and edited to ensure anonymity and to support reuse.
				Once anonymised, the materials are made available via the project website (<a
					href="https://spearhead-amr.github.io/makeaware/" class="in-text-citation"
					target="_blank">https://spearhead-amr.github.io/makeaware/</a>) as open datasets licensed under
				Creative Commons Attribution–ShareAlike 4.0 (CC BY-SA 4.0). This license allows others to use, adapt,
				and redistribute the materials for research, education, and communication, provided appropriate credit
				is given and any derivative works are shared under the same terms.
				<br><br>The media generated during the workshops and anonimised is securely stored on SUPSI’s
				institutional server, located in Switzerland. These files will be retained for five years following the
				conclusion of the project in 2024, in line with institutional research data management policies. Access
				to this material is restricted to the project team, and it will be used exclusively for:

			<h2>Workshop sign-in form</h2>
			<p>The sign-in form was used to collect participant information for workshops that formed part of the core
				methodology of the MAKEAWARE! initiative. These workshops are no longer active, as the project has
				concluded. This page serves as a public record of the project’s data practices.
				The form was designed to gather background information about participants, including their familiarity
				with antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and urinary tract infections (UTIs). This information was used to
				tailor the content and structure of the workshops during the active phase of the project.
				<br><br>The personal data collected included participants’ full names and email addresses, which were
				used to share practical information before each workshop and to collect feedback and additional input
				after the sessions. The form also automatically logged the IP address of each submission, as part of the
				standard functionality of Microsoft Forms.
				<br><br>All data submitted through the sign-in form was transmitted securely via HTTPS and stored in
				encrypted form within SUPSI’s institutional Microsoft 365 environment. The project followed Microsoft’s
				security protocols for both data in transit and data at rest, ensuring a high standard of protection
				throughout the data lifecycle. Data remained under the management of the university’s IT services and in
				compliance with institutional data governance practices. Only email addresses have been retained, while
				all other personal information has been permanently deleted. These email addresses will be stored for a
				period of five years following the project’s conclusion in 2025, after which they will be permanently
				removed from the system. Retention serves the sole purpose of enabling potential follow-up
				communication, as indicated in the original registration form. During this period, access is restricted
				to the SUPSI team members who worked on the MAKEAWARE! project and used exclusively for the purposes of
				this project as outlined in this policy. This information has not been shared with third parties,
				including other partners involved in the broader SPEARHEAD project.
				<br><br>In some cases, data collected through the form may be used to support the dissemination of
				research outcomes. However, any information included in reports, publications, or public summaries is
				fully anonymised and aggregated to illustrate participant activity and overall engagement. No personally
				identifiable information is ever disclosed in these outputs.
