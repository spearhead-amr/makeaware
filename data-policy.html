			<h2>Scope and purpose</h2>
			<p>This Data Privacy and Data Management Policy (DPDM) outlines the principles, responsibilities, and measures adopted by the MAKEAWARE! initiative to ensure the secure, ethical, and transparent handling of both personal and research data. It defines how data are collected, processed, protected, shared, and preserved throughout the project’s lifecycle.
			<br><br>The policy integrates the objectives of a Data Privacy Policy (focused on confidentiality, consent, and compliance with data protection laws — with those of a Data Management Plan) focused on the organisation, storage, and long-term stewardship of research outputs.
			<br><br>MAKEAWARE! is part of Subproject 3 of the SPEARHEAD research programme, developed by the University of Applied Sciences and Arts of Southern Switzerland (SUPSI) and funded by Innosuisse. The initiative investigates public knowledge and narratives related to antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and urinary tract infections (UTIs) through participatory and design-driven research. Individuals taking part in MAKEAWARE! contribute information and personal stories through collaborative activities. These contributions support the creation of anonymised datasets and resources intended for public use, scientific research, and communication.
			<br><br>This DPDM ensures that all data handled within MAKEAWARE! are managed in accordance with ethical research standards, institutional data governance policies, and Swiss data protection legislation.
			<br><br>MAKEAWARE! project has been reviewed and approved by the SUPSI Ethics Commission (https://www.supsi.ch/en/ethical-commission), which verified compliance with legal, ethical, and technical standards for research involving personal and health-related data.

			<h2>Repository navigation and hosting</h2>
			<p>The MAKEAWARE! website is hosted on GitHub Pages, a service operated by GitHub, Inc., part of Microsoft Corporation. The project team does not collect, store, or process any personal or identifiable information from site visitors. However, GitHub may automatically gather certain technical and navigation data—such as IP addresses, browser types, usage statistics, and cookies—as part of its platform operations. These data may be collected and processed exclusively under GitHub’s own Privacy Statement (https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement) and Terms of Service. The MAKEAWARE! team has no access to and does not use any information that GitHub may collect. In accordance with GitHub’s usage policy, which restricts access to individuals aged 13 and above, the MAKEAWARE! website inherits this limitation. A link to GitHub’s privacy policy is included in the website footer to ensure transparency.

			<h2>The story collection tool</h2>
			<p>The story collection tool is an interactive interface used to collect stories and reflections related to antibiotic consumption, urinary tract infections (UTIs), and awareness of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). It invites contributors—whether former workshop participants or online visitors—to describe their experiences with antibiotic prescription and use by responding to a set of guiding questions. These prompts are designed to support structured data collection while allowing individuals to share content they consider meaningful.	
			<br><br>The form operates through an API-based system that transmits each submission directly to the project’s institutional email account. Once received, the stories are unpacked and organised into a structured dataset hosted on SUPSI’s institutional OneDrive server, following the format of the original submissions. Each text entry is preserved exactly as provided to ensure faithful representation and enable accurate subsequent analysis.
			<br><br>Collected stories are compiled into a structured dataset, in which each row corresponds to an individual contribution and each column reflects one of the original questions or prompts. Formatting elements such as colour are maintained from the original submission to support legibility and assist with early-stage interpretation.
		<br><br>No personal identifiers—such as names or contact details—are requested or stored. While certain metadata (e.g. IP addresses) may be technically included in the email transmission, such data is not accessed or used in any processing. All entries are fully anonymised before inclusion in the dataset.
	<br><br>The anonymised dataset is available for download directly from the project website. The data have been used within the MAKEAWARE! project to:
	<ul>

	<li>Generate visualisations and maps that illustrate public awareness and engagement;</li>
<li>Develop content for communication and citizen-oriented awareness campaigns on AMR and antibiotic stewardship;</li>
<li>Produce research insights to be shared with partner institutions and collaborators via publications and reports.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<br><br>The story collection tool remains open and continues to welcome new submissions as part of the ongoing dissemination and outreach phase of the MAKEAWARE! Initiative. The same policies described here will be applied.

			<h2>About SPEARHEAD</h2>
			<p>SPEARHEAD is a consortium of 8 public and 4 private Swiss institutions that have joined forces to address
				the silent pandemic of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) by launching the ‘Swiss Pandemic & AMR - Health
				Economy Awareness Detect’ (SPEARHEAD) partnership. The project has five main goals: real-time data flow
				to and from decision-makers, better use of big data for risk stratification, timely diagnostics that can
				leapfrog a centralised laboratory infrastructure, better and broader citizen and community engagement,
				and early attention to the financial implications of the proposed innovations. These goals will be used
				to mitigate the expected economic and societal impacts of AMR.</p>
