                        Thank you for participating in our research and collaboratively providing information and data to help understand and address antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in relation to urinary tract infection diseases (UTIs).
                        <br>This Privacy Policy is intended to inform participants like you about what information is collected, why it is collected, and how it can be updated, managed, exported, and deleted. The goal of this experimental initiative is to collaborate and co-create useful data and resources for those interested in understanding antibiotic properties and consumption behaviour, as well as for those who may benefit from sharing practices and stories with others in similar circumstances (UTIs, AMR, etc.). To this end, data, information, and stories shared by users will be anonymized and made available as open datasets and visual aids. Our focus is on conducting open research that is guided by safety and ethical principles, and contributing to the fight against antimicrobial resistance and urinary tract infections through a collaborative approach involving non-expert individuals.

				</h3>

				<div class="q-container">
					<p class="q-container-text-p">
						SPEARHEAD is a consortium of 8 public and 4 private Swiss institutions that have joined forces to address the silent pandemic of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) by launching the ‚ÄòSwiss Pandemic & AMR - Health Economy Awareness Detect‚Äô (SPEARHEAD) partnership. The project has five main goals: real-time data flow to and from decision-makers, better use of big data for risk stratification, timely diagnostics that can leapfrog a centralised laboratory infrastructure, better and broader citizen and community engagement, and early attention to the financial implications of the proposed innovations. These goals will be used to mitigate the expected economic and societal impacts of AMR.

                        <br>Universit√§t Basel - Innovation Office (hereinafter referred to as the Recipient) is the project leader for the real-time data flow;
