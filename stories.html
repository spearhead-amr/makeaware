			<h1>Story-collection tool</h1>
			<h2 id="abstract-text">The story-collection tool is a digital interface for collecting personal stories
				about antibiotic consumption. Questions structure the narration to guide people in sharing their
				experiences, serving as prompts that help new relevant aspects emerge and enable a systematic collection
				of data. </h2>
			<!-- <p id="introduction-title">Every story is from people who shared their experience of antibiotic consumption and related diseases. Read and explore them according to your interest:</p> -->
			<!-- about the tool -->
			<section id="story-collection-about-container">
				<h2>About the tool</h2>
				<p>To bring the patient’s voice into the understanding of illness and antibiotic consumption, it is
					essential to collect personal experiences in a flexible yet reliable way. Each story is unique, yet
					information must be clearly organised and trustworthy to be useful for research and healthcare
					professionals. Drawing on narrative medicine, the tool emphasises listening to how people perceive
					and describe their experiences to highlight what is most important to them while structuring
					information so meaning and patterns can be identified to inform strategies against antibiotic
					resistance and foster a shared space for developing more human-centred healthcare solutions. All the
					shared stories are collected and displayed in the <a href="databook.html" class="in-text-citation">databook</a>.</p>
