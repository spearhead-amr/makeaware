			  <h2 id="abstract-text">The story-collection tool is a digital interface for collecting personal stories about antibiotic consumption. Questions structure the narration to guide people in sharing their experiences, serving as prompts that help new relevant aspects emerge and enable a systematic collection of data. </h2>
			<!-- <p id="introduction-title">Every story is from people who shared their experience of antibiotic consumption and related diseases. Read and explore them according to your interest:</p> -->
			<div id="story-collection-instructions">
				<h2>Instructions</h2>

            <h2>About the tool</h2>
            <p>To bring the patientâ€™s voice into the understanding of illness and antibiotic consumption, it is essential to collect personal experiences in a flexible yet reliable way. Each story is unique, yet information must be clearly organised and trustworthy to be useful for research and healthcare professionals. Drawing on narrative medicine, the tool emphasises listening to how people perceive and describe their experiences to highlight what is most important to them while structuring information so meaning and patterns can be identified to inform strategies against antibiotic resistance and foster a shared space for developing more human-centred healthcare solutions. All the shared stories are collected and displayed in the databook.</p>
