            <p>Engaging with citizens, artists, and designers, this format introduces scientific tools to support open
                methods of knowledge production. Developed by OBOT, a nomadic wetlab, it rethinks how antibiotic
                consumption and resistance are discussed by involving participants in the collection and observation of
                body data, with particular attention to women’s experiences in healthcare.

                <p>The workshop centres on the crystallisation of tears, a phenomenon where dried tears form microscopic
                    patterns known as stagograms. First noticed in the 18th century and later studied in more detail by
                    ophthalmologists, these formations vary between individuals and open questions about the links
                    between biology, environment, and interpretation. Participants use light-field microscopes to
                    observe their own tear samples, capturing images that reveal these intricate structures.
                    The activity is both scientific and symbolic: while grounded in established laboratory procedures,
                    it also invites participants to reflect on the meaning and imagery of what they see.

                </p>
                <p>By comparing stagograms, participants explore how different interpretations emerge, how context
                    shapes scientific readings, and how personal experience becomes part of the inquiry.
                    Through this immersive process, the workshop makes visible the historical and cultural dimensions of
                    science. It creates space to question established narratives, to uncover embedded biases, and to
                    imagine new ways of relating to knowledge about the body. At the same time, it fosters data literacy
                    by guiding participants in collecting, documenting, and analysing images of their own biological
                    material.

            <p>Zoe Romano is a craftivist, digital strategist and lecturer focused on social innovation, women in tech,
                technology, open design. She graduated in Philosophy at the University of Milan, worked for several
                years in digital communication and tech, developed her social skills as media-hacktivist on precarity,
                material and immaterial labor in the creative industries. She worked for Arduino as digital strategist
                from 2013 to 2017 and then co-founded WeMake Makerspace in 2014. She’s now a consultant on R&D, teaches
                courses in various organisations and collaborates on eu-funded digital social innovation projects. She
                takes part in research/activism activities and develops projects around e-textiles and digital
                fabrication in different contexts. She’s the co-founder of OBOT (Our Bodies Our Tech), a nomadic wetlab
                and an artistic duo composed by Zoe Romano and Maddalena Fragnito working from 2020 on science and
                technology from a trans-feminist queer perspective.

            <h2>protocol</h2>
            <p>The Perturbant Fluids workshop followed a half-day format combining presentations, hands-on
                experimentation, and collective reflection. After a short introduction to the project and an overview of
                antimicrobial resistance, Zoe Romano introduced the activity and its context. Participants were then
                guided through the workshop designed by OBOT, where they collected tear samples, observed the
                crystallisation process under light-field microscopes, and documented the resulting stagograms. The
                practical session was followed by group comparison and discussion, encouraging participants to reflect
                on both the material and symbolic dimensions of scientific practice. The day closed with a final round
                of presentations and a call to action, inviting participants to continue exploring how embodied data and
                collaborative inquiry can inform awareness of antibiotic resistance.
