            <h1>From chatbots to conversational interfaces</h1>
            <p>Resources and materials from the MAKEAWARE! project were reorganised into interactive formats through the
                design of conversational interfaces. Prototypes were developed to explore new ways of accessing the
                contents, inviting participants to experiment with dialogue-based interaction as an alternative mode of
                engagement and learning.

                <p>This format was designed to guide the MAKEAWARE! team through the complete process of imagining,
                    structuring, and designing conversational systems to make the data collected during the project
                    interactively accessible. After defining a target user, purpose, and usage scenario for their
                    chatbot, participants built a knowledge base by identifying and gathering the resources needed for
                    effective responses.
                </p>
                <p>This process helped surface useful materials encountered during the project and supported a more
                    detailed organisation of data across different formats. The goal was to explore new possibilities
                    for presenting MAKEAWARE! results through the project repository and to open ideas for further
                    integration of data and formats, with particular attention to those that can better address the
                    public.

                The format is designed as a one-day workshop. It begins with a collective introduction to the goals,
                content, and examples of chatbot applications, followed by an exercise where participants, working in
                pairs, define a target user, a purpose, and a usage scenario for their chatbot. The second part focuses
                on building a knowledge base by identifying and collecting the resources the chatbot would need to
                respond effectively. In the afternoon, participants move to interface design, creating textual, audio,
                and visual elements within a prototype that illustrates how the chatbot communicates information. The
                workshop concludes with group presentations and feedback, showcasing different approaches to
                transforming initial ideas into conversational interfaces.

                This session was held only once, after which the team worked on integrating the results into the final
                repository, making the sources and materials produced available for exploration.

                The workshop functioned as an exploratory participatory process that helped identify methods for
                building a knowledge base and technically structuring the chatbot, now available in this repository
                under “Sources.” The chatbot serves a dual purpose: on one side, it presents the research topic to
                citizens by explaining practices of antibiotic consumption and resistance, without claiming to replace
                medical professionals or offering diagnostic advice; on the other, it can be used to explore the
                project’s methodology through questions designed to replicate certain formats or generate creative
                solutions for situations and phenomena in similar contexts.
