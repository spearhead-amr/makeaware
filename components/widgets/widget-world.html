    <p>The visualization shows how many resistant bacteria had been detected in 2020, out of the samples gathered. India is the country that identified the highest number of resistant bacteria. The colour of the bubble shows that India is also the second country in terms of samples analysed. The comparison between the number of resistant bacteria and the amount of samples taken gives the percentage of the samples in which had been found resistant bacteria (the more you test the more you have chances to detect what you are looking for).  It is important to specify that figures refer to microbes and not people. A one-person test can reveal more than one resistant microbe. Other criteria, such as the availability of antibiotics and the number of inhabitants, should also be contemplated in case of a deeper analysis.</p>
