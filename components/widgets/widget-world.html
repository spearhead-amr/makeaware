    <h1>How many resistant bacteria have been detected Worldwide?</h1>
    <p>Around the world, scientists have identified hundreds of bacteria that no longer respond to one or more antibiotics. The exact number keeps changing as resistance spreads and evolves. The World Health Organization (WHO) has listed over 30 high-risk bacteria that are already resistant to many common antibiotics. Every year, antimicrobial resistance (AMR) causes more than 1 million deaths globally, with millions more suffering from longer, more serious illnesses. In 2019, about 4.95 million deaths around the world were associated with antimicrobial resistance (AMR) â€” meaning that infections could not be effectively treated because the bacteria had become resistant to antibiotics. In 2019, 4.95 million deaths worldwide were associated with bacterial infections that were difficult to treat due to antimicrobial resistance (AMR), and 1.27 million deaths were directly caused by infections that could not be cured because antibiotics were no longer effective. This makes AMR one of the most significant global health threats today.
    </br></br>In Switzerland, the situation is moderate. While the country has a relatively balanced level of antibiotic resistance compared to other nations, the numbers remain stable. While the country holds an intermediate position in terms of antibiotic-resistant microbes, its data is relatively stable compared to some other nations. In 2019, 158 resistant bacteria were identified from 1,958 tests, resulting in a positivity rate of 8%. Among European countries, Switzerland's resistance rates are lower than those of its border countries like Germany, France, and Italy. However, Nordic countries tend to report even lower rates of resistance. Switzerland's diverse linguistic and cultural regions play a role in its antibiotic prescription practices. For instance, French- and Italian-speaking cantons tend to have higher antibiotic consumption compared to German-speaking areas. This cultural influence on healthcare practices highlights the need for tailored strategies to reduce antibiotic misuse and promote more responsible prescribing habits.
