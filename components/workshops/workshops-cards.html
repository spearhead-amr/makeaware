            <p>As MAKEAWARE! approaches its final phase, this workshop creates a space for reflection on the
                challenges and insights that have emerged around data collection and use in design
                practicesâ€”particularly within healthcare contexts, by bringing together leading experts in
                design
                research, working at the intersection of participatory practices, data ethics, and health.</p>

            <p>This workshop offers participants an exciting opportunity to deepen their understanding of
                antibiotics and antibiotic resistance through the digitization of the antibiogram test, made
                possible outside of microbiology laboratories. Attendees will be able to broaden their knowledge
                of
                antibiotics and antibiotic resistance, and explore the role of these life-saving drugs in modern
                medicine.</p>

            <p>Antimicrobial resistance is a global threat that directly or indirectly affects each and every
                one of
                us. On the 21st of June, people who experienced antimicrobial resistance, together with
                healthcare
                professionals, will be working supported by designers to envision possible technology solutions
                to
                the challenge of resistance development.</p>

            <p>This workshop proposes an hands-on experience to learn and discover the science around
                antimicrobial
                resistance. Starting from scientific contents, the activities will engage the participants in
                the
                creation of a collaborative repository of images, resources and stories that will help
                contributing
                to the fight against antibiotics misuses and its consequences.</p>

            <p>Perturbant Fluids workshop aims to enhance and disseminate bodily autonomy and rethink possible
                relationships with the "perturbing" entities that embody us. During this workshop participants
                will
                be involved in the discovery of scientific protocols and tools to redefine the way we can
                contribute
                and redesign the narrative around science.</p>

                Did
                you have any troubles with the treatment? Was the antibiotic not effective or did it cause side
