            <p>The workshop combines hands-on microbiology with interactive digital tools to make the science behind antimicrobial resistance accessible outside traditional laboratories. Participants work with DiPLab, a digital simulation of laboratory testing, to observe bacteria, explore how resistance is detected, and solve real case studies in groups. The format fosters collaborative learning, problem-solving, and discussion on responsible antibiotic use, enabling both educators and students to actively engage with this critical health challenge.</p>

            <p>A multidisciplinary workshop bringing together participants from medicine, design, technology, and civic organisations to address antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and its impact on health. Working in teams, participants prototype a chatbot conversation aimed at supporting better antibiotic use. Through this process, they explore which data should be collected, what information is most valuable, and how personal experiences with antibiotic consumption and prescription can inform improved practices.</p>

            <p>This hands-on workshop uses data physicalization to explain how antibiotics work and how resistance develops, focusing on urinary tract infections (UTIs) as a common cause of AMR. By representing their own treatment experiences and consumption habits as tangible artefacts, participants are encouraged to connect personal data with scientific information, gaining a deeper understanding of how antimicrobial resistance develops. The format fosters discussion, builds data literacy, and promotes responsible antibiotic use by linking scientific concepts to lived experience.</p>

            <p>This immersive activity engage participants in using laboratory tools and protocols to collect and analyse their own data and samples. Microscopic observation reveals unique crystallisation patterns in tears, documented as “stagograms” within a shared visual repository. Hands-on experimentation connects personal biological data with scientific methods, fostering bodily awareness and collaborative interpretation. The format bridges professional microbiology with personal exploration, transforming scientific observation into a means of self-awareness and inquiry.</p>

            <p>In this format, women with experience of urinary tract infections (UTIs) use physical materials to represent and communicate their symptoms. Guided through symptom identification, material exploration, and object-making, participants interpret and translate personal experiences into tangible forms to improve the communication of the disease. Integrating data physicalisation methods with healthcare information aims to foster reflection, build a shared vocabulary for describing symptoms, and support clearer communication with healthcare professionals.</p>

            <p>This workshop engages the MAKEAWARE! team from the MA in Interaction Design in designing and prototyping a chatbot to reimagine the communication of antimicrobial resistance and antibiotic consumption. Participants define user needs and tone of voice, structure a knowledge base from curated data, and design the conversational interface. By merging interaction design methods with healthcare communication, the format explores how conversational agents can make complex scientific and medical information accessible, relevant, and engaging.</p>

            <p>This kitchen-based educational lab engages participants in growing and observing their vaginal microbiome through accessible tools and adapted laboratory protocols. It links scientific knowledge with personal awareness, encouraging reflection on intimate health, the role of the vaginal microbiome, and its social, political, and cultural dimensions. By enabling safe home-based experimentation, the format fosters a deeper understanding of body–microbe symbiosis, promotes open discussion, challenges taboos, and supports collective knowledge-making for self-exploration and empowerment.</p>

            <p>A reflective workshop marking the conclusion of the project, designed to bring partners and stakeholders into dialogue about the achievements of the past four years and potential directions ahead. Subproject leaders act as facilitators, contributing selected images from their journey to be cut, rearranged, and reassembled with input from other consortium members and external participants. This collaborative act of making becomes a tool for conversation, sparking new ideas, identifying opportunities for collaboration, and collectively shaping a shared vision for the future.</p>
