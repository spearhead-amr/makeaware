					Biofilie Lab is a kitchen based educational lab to learn how to grow vaginal microbiome at home. 
					During the workshop, participants will access the procedure of the Biofilie Lab protocol and explore their personal relationship with vaginal 
					microbiome and its understanding following recent scientific studies. There is a growing interest in the vaginal microbiome from the citizen science 
					field, but there is still room to discuss the power balance in the conversation. Biofilie Lab is also an interdisciplinary project aimed to explore 
					the biosocial and political intersectionality of human-vaginal microbiome combining disciplines like art, design, microbiology, medical anthropology 
					and feminist theories. The project will engage in a political questioning of the emergence of the new scientific understandings on vaginal microbiome.

						During the MAKEAWARE! workshops, participants will be asked to collaborate and share personal experiences and stories about antimicrobial and antibiotic resistance, antibiotic consumption, and urinary tract infection diseases and remedies. Different media such as photos, graphics, and texts will be used to document the outputs of the collaboration process. The outputs will be edited or coded and shared via the repository as anonymized open datasets for anyone to use.
