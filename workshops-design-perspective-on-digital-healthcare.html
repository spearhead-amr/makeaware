            <h1>Design Perspectives on Digital Health</h1>
            <p>
                This conversation-based workshop marks the concluding moment of the MAKEAWARE!-Spearhead initiative. The format is designed to foster interdisciplinary exchange, combining perspectives from design research, health practice, and technology development. Engaging in dialogue, the seminar aims to refine the MAKEAWARE! outcomes, enrich design research with diverse perspectives, and identify new areas for collaboration in digital healthcare.

                    The seminar is structured as a full-day activity to share project results and open an interdisciplinary dialogue with experts and students. In the morning session, the MAKEAWARE! team will present outcomes from three years of research, including stories collected through the digital story-collection tool, which captures patient experiences of antibiotic use. These materials will serve as a starting point for a discussion with invited experts, who will be asked to evaluate the approach and provide feedback on data collection methods and their potential adoption in healthcare design.

                    In the afternoon session, experts from international institutions—including Arthi Manohar (Brunel University London), Aylin Tschoepe (Basel Academy of Art and Design, MetaLab Basel), Laura Ferrarello (EPFL Lausanne), Teresa Almeida (Instituto Superior Técnico, Lisbon), Sara Levati (Department of Business Economics, Health and Social Care, SUPSI), and Paulina Yurman (University of the Arts London)—will present their projects in design and healthcare. Each presentation will illustrate how data is defined, collected, visualised, or used in prototyping, offering students and participants insights into real-world applications of design research. The session is open to students of the Master in Interaction Design as well as colleagues from architecture, visual communication, engineering, and related fields.

<P>The seminar was chaired by Serena Cangiano, project leader and senior research associate at the SUPSI Design Institute, together with Ginevra Terenghi, doctoral student at SUPSI and Brunel University. In the morning, the invited researchers joined the discussion on the project’s results, and in the afternoon they presented their own work before engaging in an open dialogue with the public. The contributors included:

                            Paulina Yurmane</a> is a Research Fellow, designer and lecturer at Central Saint Martins in London. She is the recipient of a Wellcome research grant for her 4-year long project Maternal Machines: Design Speculations about Fantasies of Care, which investigates future imaginaries of maternal and infant care and looks to identify opportunities for wellbeing. Her research blends critical design with speculative methods to question and reimagine our relationships with technology. Her work often critically explores how we live with design and technology in everyday life.
