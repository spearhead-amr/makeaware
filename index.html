		<h1>PROJECT DESCRIPTION</h1>
		<p>Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) happens when germs—like bacteria, viruses, fungi, or parasites—change in ways
			that make the medicines used to treat them stop working. These medicines, called antimicrobials, include
			antibiotics (used for bacteria), antivirals (for viruses), antifungals (for fungi), and antiparasitics (for
			parasites). When the microbes no longer respond to treatment, the infection becomes harder or even
			impossible to cure.</p>

		<p>Due to biological factors, UTIs predominantly affect women, yet the condition remains significantly under-researched, especially in its chronic or recurrent forms (Huttner, 2023). This imbalance highlights how gender can shape both health outcomes and research priorities, reinforcing the need for more inclusive and equitable approaches in medical research and public health policy. Building on this foundation, MAKEAWARE! has developed and tested a dedicated design research framework that explores how citizen participation can enhance both awareness and data generation around AMR. By involving participants in creative, hands-on workshops, developed in collaboration with experts from science, technology, and communication, the project promotes a bottom-up approach to data co-creation.</br></br>These activities invite individuals to reflect on personal experiences, treatment habits, and attitudes toward antibiotic use, generating valuable insights while fostering a deeper public understanding of AMR. The resulting methods, materials, and findings are shared openly in this repository to support further experimentation, and discussion. The MAKEAWARE! initiative is part of SPEARHEAD, an Innosuisse-funded project that brings together a consortium of eight public and four private Swiss institutions to tackle AMR from multiple perspectives. SPEARHEAD—Swiss Pandemic & AMR Health Economy Awareness Detect—is based on a multidisciplinary, research-driven approach that integrates digital tools with a patient-centered focus, emphasizing antimicrobial stewardship and prevention.

		<p>This resistance can develop naturally over time, but the process has sped up because of how we use antimicrobials, such as taking medicines when we don’t need them; not finishing the full course of treatment; using antibiotics in animals to promote faster growth; and poor hygiene and infection control in hospitals and communities.
These resistant germs don’t stay in one place. They can spread between people, animals, and the environment, crossing borders and causing infections that are more difficult to treat, more expensive to manage, and more likely to lead to serious illness or death.
AMR affects more than just hospitals—it also threatens food safety, global trade, and the ability to perform common medical procedures like surgeries or chemotherapy. Because of these wide impacts, the World Health Organization (WHO) has declared AMR as one of the top 10 public health threats facing humanity.
