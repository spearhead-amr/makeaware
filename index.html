				<h1>PROJECT DESCRIPTION</h1>
				<p>Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) happens when germs—like bacteria, viruses, fungi, or parasites—change
					in ways
					that make the medicines used to treat them stop working. These medicines, called antimicrobials,
					include
					antibiotics (used for bacteria), antivirals (for viruses), antifungals (for fungi), and
					antiparasitics (for
					parasites). When the microbes no longer respond to treatment, the infection becomes harder or even
					impossible to cure.</p>

					<p>Due to biological factors, UTIs predominantly affect women, yet the condition remains
						significantly under-researched, especially in its chronic or recurrent forms (Huttner, 2023).
						This imbalance highlights how gender can shape both health outcomes and research priorities,
						reinforcing the need for more inclusive and equitable approaches in medical research and public
						health policy. Building on this foundation, MAKEAWARE! has developed and tested a dedicated
						design research framework that explores how citizen participation can enhance both awareness and
						data generation around AMR. By involving participants in creative, hands-on workshops, developed
						in collaboration with experts from science, technology, and communication, the project promotes
						a bottom-up approach to data co-creation.</br></br>These activities invite individuals to
						reflect on personal experiences, treatment habits, and attitudes toward antibiotic use,
						generating valuable insights while fostering a deeper public understanding of AMR. The resulting
						methods, materials, and findings are shared openly in this repository to support further
						experimentation, and discussion. The MAKEAWARE! initiative is part of SPEARHEAD, an
						Innosuisse-funded project that brings together a consortium of eight public and four private
						Swiss institutions to tackle AMR from multiple perspectives. SPEARHEAD—Swiss Pandemic & AMR
						Health Economy Awareness Detect—is based on a multidisciplinary, research-driven approach that
						integrates digital tools with a patient-centered focus, emphasizing antimicrobial stewardship
						and prevention.

					<p>This resistance can develop naturally over time, but the process has sped up because of how we
						use antimicrobials, such as taking medicines when we don’t need them; not finishing the full
						course of treatment; using antibiotics in animals to promote faster growth; and poor hygiene and
						infection control in hospitals and communities.
						These resistant germs don’t stay in one place. They can spread between people, animals, and the
						environment, crossing borders and causing infections that are more difficult to treat, more
						expensive to manage, and more likely to lead to serious illness or death.
						AMR affects more than just hospitals—it also threatens food safety, global trade, and the
						ability to perform common medical procedures like surgeries or chemotherapy. Because of these
						wide impacts, the World Health Organization (WHO) has declared AMR as one of the top 10 public
						health threats facing humanity.

				<h1>Which geographic region has the highest number of resistant bacteria in Switzerland?</h1>
				<p>In Switzerland, the distribution of antibiotic-resistant bacteria varies across its different
					linguistic and cultural regions. The country’s geographic and socio-cultural diversity plays a
					significant role in how antibiotics are prescribed and consumed, influencing the prevalence of
					resistant bacteria. In 2019, Switzerland had a positivity rate of 8% for antibiotic-resistant
					bacteria, with 158 resistant strains identified from 1,958 tests. This rate places Switzerland in an
					intermediate position compared to other European countries, with lower resistance rates than its
					border nations (e.g., Germany, France, and Italy) but higher rates than the Nordic countries.
					</br></br>French- and Italian-speaking cantons tend to have higher antibiotic consumption compared
					to German-speaking cantons. This regional variation in antibiotic use is largely due to cultural
					differences in healthcare practices, with different attitudes toward prescribing and using
					antibiotics in outpatient settings. As a result, French- and Italian-speaking regions are more
					likely to see higher rates of antibiotic resistance due to increased antibiotic usage, which can
					lead to a greater opportunity for bacteria to develop resistance. The higher consumption in French-
					and Italian-speaking regions, such as Geneva, Ticino, and parts of Vaud, is linked to relatively
					higher resistance rates compared to the German-speaking cantons like Zurich and Bern, where
					antibiotic use tends to be more cautious and controlled. However, precise regional data within
					Switzerland remains somewhat generalised, with national surveillance efforts rather than very
					localised reporting.

				<h1>What is the impact of antimicrobial resistance in the future?</h1>
				<p>Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) will have severe and far-reaching consequences for both individuals
					and healthcare systems. As antibiotic resistance increases, infections will become more difficult to
					treat, leading to longer illnesses and hospitalizations. This will result in higher treatment costs
					for both patients and healthcare systems. The need for alternative medications and more intensive
					care will put a significant financial strain on resources. Moreover, patients will face disruptions
					to their lives as they undergo prolonged treatments and make lifestyle changes, affecting both them
					and their families. In the worst-case scenario, AMR could lead to disability or even death.
					</br></br>Looking to the future, projections suggest that by 2050, 10 million people could die each
					year from AMR, potentially making it the leading cause of death, surpassing even cancer. While
					estimates vary due to the complex factors involved, the numbers highlight the urgency of addressing
					AMR as a global health threat that requires immediate, coordinated action to prevent a public health
					crisis.

				<h1>When did the lack of antibiotics start?</h1>
				<p>The issue of antibiotic shortages can be traced back to a slow-down in the development of new
					antibiotics. Nearly all the antibiotics in use today are based on discoveries made over 30 years
					ago. Since 2017, only 12 new antibiotics have been approved, with 10 of them belonging to existing
					antibiotic classes, which are groups of antibiotics that share similar chemical structures and
					mechanisms of action. These classes are defined by their core molecular structure or the way they
					interact with bacteria to stop their growth or kill them. When bacteria develop resistance to one
					antibiotic within a class, it often leads to resistance against other antibiotics in the same class,
					making it harder to treat infections. As a result, there is an urgent need for novel classes of
					antibiotics. These would be antibiotics that have fundamentally different structures or mechanisms
					of action compared to existing drugs, allowing them to bypass the resistance mechanisms that
					bacteria have developed against older drugs.
					</br></br>However, discovering new antibiotic classes has proven difficult due to significant
					scientific barriers. Additionally, research into novel antibiotics is often deprioritised in favour
					of projects that offer quicker commercial returns and don't require the long development time needed
					for new antibiotics. While some studies are exploring non-antibiotic alternatives, especially for
					the prevention of urinary tract infections (UTIs), these have not yet been shown to be effective
					enough to be officially prescribed. As a result, the shortage of new antibiotics remains a critical
					challenge, limiting our ability to keep up with the growing threat of resistance. Recently,
					scientists, with the help of artificial intelligence (AI), discovered a new antibiotic called
					zosurabalpin, effective against Carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (CRAB), a highly
					resistant bacterium commonly found in hospitals. This breakthrough revitalises the fight against
					tough-to-treat infections caused by resistant bacteria, offering new possibilities for antibiotic
					development and highlighting innovative approaches in drug discovery.
