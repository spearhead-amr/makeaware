				<h1>PROJECT DESCRIPTION</h1>
				<p>MAKEAWARE! is an initiative running from 2022 to 2025, developed at the Institute of Design (IDe) at
					the University of Applied Sciences and Arts of Southern Switzerland (SUPSI). Its mission is to raise
					public awareness and actively engage citizens in the fight against Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR)
					through interactive, data-driven activities that promote participation and understanding.</p>
				<div class="divider"></div>
				<div class="description-content">
					<img src="assets/img/pages/home/makeaware-project-description.jpg">
					<p>The project is framed with a special focus on women and aims to uncover and address gender-based
						disparities in the healthcare system, particularly in how data about women is collected,
						considered, and analysed from a perspective that reflects their specific experiences and needs.
						It focuses on urinary tract infections (UTIs), which are among the most common infections
						contributing to AMR globally <a href="#" target="blank">(Autor, Year)</a> . Due to biological
						factors, UTIs predominantly affect women,
						yet the condition remains significantly under-researched, especially in its chronic or recurrent
						forms <a href="#" target="blank">(Autor, Year)</a>.
						This imbalance highlights how gender can shape both health outcomes and research priorities,
						reinforcing the need for more inclusive and equitable approaches in medical research and public
						health policy.</br></br>Building on this foundation, MAKEAWARE! has developed and tested a
						dedicated design research framework that explores how citizen participation can enhance both
						awareness and data generation around AMR. By involving participants in creative, hands-on
						workshops developed in collaboration with experts from science, technology, and communication,
						the project promotes a bottom-up approach to data co-creation. These activities invite
						individuals to reflect on personal experiences, treatment habits, and attitudes toward
						antibiotic use, generating valuable insights while fostering a deeper public understanding of
						AMR. The resulting methods, materials, and findings are shared openly in this repository to
						support further experimentation and discussion. The MAKEAWARE! initiative is part of SPEARHEAD,
						an Innosuisse-funded project that brings together a consortium of eight public and four private
						Swiss institutions to tackle AMR from multiple perspectives. SPEARHEAD—Swiss Pandemic & AMR
						Health Economy Awareness Detect—is based on a multidisciplinary, research-driven approach that
						integrates digital tools with a patient-centred focus, emphasising antimicrobial stewardship and
						prevention.

				<h1>What is antimicrobial resistance?</h1>
				<p id="widget-amr-abstract">Antimicrobial resistance refers to the ability of microorganisms such as
					bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites to withstand the effects of medications that are intended to
					eliminate or inhibit them. As a result, treatments including antibiotics, antivirals, antifungals,
					and antiparasitic agents become less effective or ineffective, making the management and control of
					infections more difficult.</p>
				<div class="divider"></div>

				<div id="widget-amr-content">
					<img src="assets/img/pages/home/antibiotics-scheme.svg">
					<p>This resistance can develop naturally over time, but the process has sped up because of how we
						use antimicrobials, such as taking medicines when we don't need them; not finishing the full
						course of treatment; using antibiotics in animals to promote faster growth; and poor hygiene and
						infection control in hospitals and communities.
						These resistant germs don't stay in one place. They can spread between people, animals, and the
						environment, crossing borders and causing infections that are more difficult to treat, more
						expensive to manage, and more likely to lead to serious illness or death.
						AMR affects more than just hospitals—it also threatens food safety, global trade, and the
						ability to perform common medical procedures like surgeries or chemotherapy. Because of these
						wide impacts, the World Health Organization (WHO) has declared AMR as one of the top 10 public
						health threats facing humanity.

				<h1>Which geographic region has the highest number of resistant bacteria in Switzerland?</h1>
				<p>Antibiotic resistance in Switzerland reflects both its geographic position and socio-cultural
					diversity. Nationally, Switzerland occupies an intermediate position within Europe, with lower
					resistance rates than surrounding countries such as Germany, France, and Italy, but higher than
					those observed in Nordic nations. This moderate resistance level is shaped by varying prescribing
					habits and healthcare practices, influenced by both medical culture and public attitudes toward
					antibiotics. These patterns underscore the importance of ongoing national surveillance and the need
					for targeted public health strategies to ensure antibiotics are used appropriately.
				</p>
				<div class="descriptive-text">
					<p>
						Within Switzerland, regional differences in language and culture significantly affect antibiotic
						use and resistance. French- and Italian-speaking cantons, including Geneva, Ticino, and Vaud,
						typically report higher antibiotic consumption compared to German-speaking regions like Zurich
						and Bern. This is largely due to differing healthcare practices and attitudes toward antibiotic
						prescribing in outpatient care.
					</p>
					<p>As a result, higher antibiotic use in these areas can create more opportunities for bacteria to
						develop resistance, contributing to relatively elevated resistance rates. While national
						surveillance provides general trends, more localised data would support the development of
						region-specific measures to promote responsible antibiotic use and curb resistance.</p>

				<h1>What is the impact of antimicrobial resistance in the future?</h1>
				<p>Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) poses a serious and growing threat with profound consequences for
					individuals, healthcare systems, and society at large. As antibiotic resistance increases,
					infections become harder to treat, leading to longer illness durations, extended hospital stays, and
					more complex care. This not only places a greater emotional and physical burden on patients and
					their families but also significantly increases healthcare costs due to the need for alternative
					treatments and intensive medical support.
				</p>
				<div class="descriptive-text">
					<p>The wider impact includes disruptions to everyday life, reduced productivity, and long-term
						health complications. In severe cases, antimicrobial resistance can result in permanent
						disability or even death. Looking ahead, projections estimate that by the year 2050,
						antimicrobial resistance could cause up to 10 million deaths each year, possibly making it the
						most common cause of death in the world, even ahead of cancer.</p>
					<p>Although estimates differ due to the complex nature of the issue, the overall trend highlights
						the urgent need for a coordinated and global response to prevent antimicrobial resistance from
						developing into a major public health crisis.</p>

				<h1>When did the lack of antibiotics start?</h1>
				<p>Antibiotic shortages are largely due to a slowdown in the development of new drugs. Most antibiotics
					used today are based on discoveries made more than 30 years ago, and since 2017, only 12 new ones
					have been approved. Most of these belong to existing classes, which are groups of antibiotics that
					share similar structures and mechanisms. When bacteria become resistant to one antibiotic in a
					class, they are often resistant to others in the same group, making treatment more difficult and
					highlighting the urgent need for completely new types of antibiotics.
				</p>
				<div class="descriptive-text">
					<p> However, developing new antibiotic classes is challenging due to complex scientific obstacles
						and limited financial incentives. Research often focuses on projects with faster commercial
						returns rather than long-term antibiotic development. Although some studies are investigating
						non-antibiotic alternatives, especially for preventing urinary tract infections, these are not
						yet effective enough for medical use.</p>
					<p>Scientists recently discovered a new antibiotic called zosurabalpin using advanced computer
						technology and artificial intelligence (AI). This antibiotic has proven effective against
						hard-to-treat bacteria commonly found in hospitals, offering new possibilities for antibiotic
						development and highlighting innovative approaches in drug discovery.</p>
