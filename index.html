		<h2>Data pills and workshops to raise awareness on antibiotic consumption and antimicrobial resistance.</h2>
		<h3>What is antimicrobial resistance?</h3>
		<h4>Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) happens when germs—like bacteria, viruses, fungi, or parasites—change in ways
			that make the medicines used to treat them stop working. These medicines, called antimicrobials, include
			antibiotics (used for bacteria), antivirals (for viruses), antifungals (for fungi), and antiparasitics (for
			parasites). When the microbes no longer respond to treatment, the infection becomes harder or even
			impossible to cure.</h4>
