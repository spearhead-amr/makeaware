            <h1>Visualizing the Resistance</h1>
            <p>To engage participants in understanding how antibiotics work and how resistance develops, this hands-on workshop uses data visualisation techniques. By observing bacterial growth and antibiotic action, elements of the Kirby-Bauer test are adapted to translate treatment experiences into petri dish representations, linking personal stories with scientific evidence to foster data literacy and dialogue on responsible antibiotic use.

<p>This workshop provides a hands-on experience to explore antimicrobial resistance through practical microbiology activities designed for easy replication in diverse settings. Through interactive, hands-on activities in a real microbiology laboratory, this workshop immerses participants in the science of antimicrobial resistance by answering fundamental questions such as: What are antibiotics? How do they work? What does antimicrobial resistance mean? The activity refers to the concept of the antibiogram, which is the action performed by scientists in the laboratory to test the efficacy of antibiotics on specific bacteria. In order to do so, antibiotic pills are placed into a transparent lidded dish (called Petri dish) covered with bacteria. After some cultivation hours, it is possible to observe the efficacy of antibiotics that prevent bacteria from growing. The higher the antibiotic efficacy, the less the bacteria spread, leaving an empty space around the pill. On the other hand, the smaller the area, the higher the resistance development of microbes which are not affected by the antibiotic.
    </p>
    <p>Participants begin with an introduction to antimicrobial resistance and the importance of responsible antibiotic use. They then move to a microbiology laboratory, where safety procedures are explained, and they learn about antibiotics and bacterial differences through microscope observations. Following step-by-step instructions, participants culture bacteria, Escherichia coli first, on Petri dishes and place antibiotic pills based on their personal responses to questions about antibiotic use and health habits. After incubation, the clear zones around the antibiotics where bacteria do not grow reveal the effectiveness of each drug and highlight the link between individual behaviour and resistance development. The workshop combines rigorous scientific content with interactive and creative engagement to empower participants in the fight against antibiotic misuse. Because the activities involve live microorganisms and antibiotics, they are conducted in microbiology laboratories and facilitated by microbiology experts who co-designed the format.

                <p>The format has been developed in collaboration with Cristina Fragoso Corti and Pamela Princi, and was hosted at the Applied Microbiology Laboratory of SUPSI.
Since 2012, Cristina has been a researcher at SUPSI’s Laboratory of Applied Microbiology, focusing on microorganism detection, characterisation, and applied research. She graduated in Microbiology from the Catholic University of Porto in 2000 and earned a master’s degree from the Institute for Research in Biomedicine in Bellinzona in 2002.
Pamela Principi is a senior researcher and lecturer at SUPSI’s Institute of Microbiology, leading the Environmental Biotechnology sector. She holds a Biology degree and a Ph.D. in Chemistry, Biochemistry, and Ecology of Pesticides. Since 1999, she has focused on applied microbiology in environmental and cultural heritage projects, with experience in European research and international collaborations.

                <h2>sessions</h2>
                <p>A total of five sessions of this activity have been conducted, involving approximately 40 participants. Two workshops were open to external participants recruited through the project’s network and local pharmacies; two were tailored for nursing students with limited laboratory experience; and one was developed for master’s-level design students, introducing them to the themes of antimicrobial resistance and antibiotic use within the context of a design challenge.

                <h2>data policy</h2>
                <p>During the MAKEAWARE! workshops, participants will be asked to collaborate and share personal experiences and stories about antimicrobial and antibiotic resistance, antibiotic consumption, and urinary tract infection diseases and remedies. Different media such as photos, graphics, and texts will be used to document the outputs of the collaboration process. The outputs will be edited or coded and shared via the repository as anonymized open datasets for anyone to use. Learn more about the use of data in the <a href="http://localhost:3000/data-policy.html">Data Privacy and Management Policy Page</a>.</p>
